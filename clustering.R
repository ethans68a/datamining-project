# idea is to see what songs might be grouped together for a "music discovery" playlist
# but is not based on genre. The songs should not be so random as to have a sudden change 
# in musical attributes but can be of different genres. The point is that the 
# playlist pulls from multiple genres to help the user discover songs.

# to preprocess we will remove genre labels as they are not needed
# or maybe we can keep to see how many different genres end up in each cluster
